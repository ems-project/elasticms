## EMSCO (CoreBundle)

### Asset

#### Refresh file fields

This command ensure that all file fields, for all revisions, are using the last asset's fields:

 * _hash
 * _size
 * _algo
 * _type
 * _name

That will have to be launch at least once between August 2024 and the release 7.x. 
By then the fields `filename`, `filesize`, `sha1` and `mimetype` are deprecated.

This command regenerate resized images in order to avoid too much memory consumption on image generation.
So you might consider to launch this commend if you adjust the `EMSCO_IMAGE_MAX_SIZE` environment variable.

**Cautions**

This command will mark all revision as updated by the `SYSTEM_REFRESH_FILE_FIELDS` user in the admin UI.

```bash
Usage:
  emsco:asset:refresh-file-fields

```

### Content Type

#### Content Type switch default environment

Switch the default environment for a given content type.
Each revision published in the default environment will be marked as published in the provided environment.
Each revision published in the provided environment will be mark as published in the default environment.
The content type's environment by default will be set to the provided environment. 

**Cautions**

* This command should never be run in a production environment without a good backup.
* Affected environments must be rebuilded just after. As many content types might be switched, the command doesn't automatically rebuilding them. After this command affected indexes will be inconsistent.



```bash
Usage:
  emsco:contenttype:switch-default-env <contentType> <target-environment>

Arguments:
  contentType           ContentType
  target-environment    Target environment

```

#### Content Type transform

`@todo add documentation content transformers`

```bash
Usage:
  emsco:contenttype:transform [options] [--] <content-type>

#### Revision delete

Delete all/oldest revisions for content type(s).

In `oldest` mode, only not published revisions will be removed and keeping revisions between publications.

```

It's also possible to delete revision by passing a query. In this case the provided elasticsearch query is run all all OUUIDs are collected.
Base on those OUUIDs all revisions in the database and all documents in all managed indexes are deleted.

```bash
 php bin/console ems:rev:dele --mode=by-query --query='{"index":"ems_default","body":{"query":{"bool":{"must":[{"term":{"host":{"value":"domain.tld","boost":1}}},{"terms":{"_contenttype":["audit"]}}]}}}}'

#### Revision task notification mail

Send a notification mail to assignees, creators and task managers.

Creates a list of all active tasks, ordered by the deadline. 
You can define the deadline start and end with the deadline options.

Loops over all tasks and checks:
- If the task is in progress, add to the list of tasks for the assignee
- If the task is completed, add to the list of tasks for the creator
- If include-task-managers is true, add to the list of tasks for the manager

For each receiver (assignee, creator, manager), we check if email notification is turn on.
By default, we only send a list of the 10 first result (can be increase with limit option).

### XLIFF 

The core supports XLIFF exports and imports to have some content translated by a translation office.

> **LIMITATIONS**
> 
> At this point elasticms only supports XLIFF translation in separated documents. In other words a document is associated to one and only one language. Those documents needs:
> 
> - A keyword field to identify the document's locale i.e. a `locale` field contains values like `'fr'`, `'en'`
> - A keyword field to link documents that are translation of each other. It can be a `menu_uid` referring to a JSON Menu entry or a data link
> 
> So the couple of those two fields must be unique by environment.
> 
> A support where fields such as `title_fr` and `title_nl` are in the same document is feasible but is not yet supported


#### XLIFF extract

This command generates an XML in a [XLIFF format 1.2](http://docs.oasis-open.org/xliff/xliff-core/xliff-core.html).

This command will
- extract the fields `description`, `title_short` and `title`
- for the document with the OUUID `db27a1da21b8d9c556abe67451007cd0ad80c54b` if it exists in the `next` environment
- The expected locale of this document should be `nl`
- It will try to identify a `de` document having the same `translation_id`  in the `latest`
  - The translatable fields of this document will be used as default target value
- It will check if something has changed for the current revision of the document, for the translatable fields, of the revision
  - in the `latest` environment with the same OUUID
  - If nothing changed, and if a target is defined it will mark the target's state as `final`

```
emsco:xliff:extract next '{"query":{"bool":{"must":[{"term":{"_id":{"value":"db27a1da21b8d9c556abe67451007cd0ad80c54b"}}},{"terms":{"_contenttype":["page","template"]}}]}}}' nl de description title_short title --base-url=http://example.localhost --target-environment=latest

  fields                                         List of content type\s fields to extract. Use the pattern %locale% if required. Use the `.` to separate nested fields from their parent. Use `json:` `id_key:` and/or `base64;` to decode a field. You can also use `*` as wild char and `|` to list children fields  E.g. `%locale%.json:id_key:content.object.title|content` or `[%locale%][json:id_key:content][object][title|content]`

Options:
      --bulk-size=BULK-SIZE                      Size of the elasticsearch scroll request [default: 500]

```

#### XLIFF update

If a `publish-to` is specified in the options, the command will check if something as changed in source fields between the default environment and the `publish-to` one. If nothing changed and if the target fields are defined those target's sate will be marked as `'final'`

This command will:
- Load the XLIFF file passed as argument
- Each source document's revisions are identified in the XLIFF file. That exact revision will be used to generate a new revision for the target locale (defined in the XLIFF file)
- The target OUUID will be identified via an elasticsearch query looking for a single document
  - In the `latest` environment (as it's specified in the `publish-to` option, otherwise it will look in the default environment of the revision)
  - Having the same `translation_id` field value
  - Having the locale field value set to target locale
  - If not found a new document with a brand new OUUID will be generate
- As a `publish-to` environment is defined, translated revisions will be directly published in that environment
- As the archive option is set the translated revisions will be unpublished from there default environment and mark as archived
  - This option is available only if a `publish-to` environment is defined


 ```
