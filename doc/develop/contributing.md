# Contributing

All contributes can be done by forking
or [monorepo](https://github.com/ems-project/elasticms) and created pull
requests.

## Code Quality

Quality off the pull requests is insured by:

- [PHP Coding Standards Fixer](https://cs.symfony.com)
- [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/)
- [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/)

Our composer has aliases defined for checking before submitting pull request.

```bash
composer phpall
composer phpcs
composer phpstan
composer phpunit
```

[Rector](https://getrector.org/) is also available for ensuring that PHP and
Symfony best practices are followed.

`````bash
composer rector
`````

## Pull requests

Submitted pull requests will be validated by elasticms developers and merged
when approved.
Add a good description, detailed commit messages and multiple small pull
requests is preferred.

### Target branch

Bugfixes should always target the lowest branch possible.

New features should target the default branch.

### Title rules

The pull request title should follow the
git [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard.
This is forced with a GitHub action.

On merge all commits are squashed and the PR title is used as commit message.
Sub commits inside the pull request are not required to follow the conventional
commits standard.

Examples:

* fix(user): update profile 500 error
* fix(user): change password not updating
* feat(wysiwyg): media library support
